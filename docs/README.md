# Install
## Supported hardware and OS
RSPlayer can be installed on Linux systems with the following CPU architectures:
* [x] Linux amd64(x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu) - x86 intel and amd cpus 
* [x] Linux aarch64(aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu) - arm 64bit cpus: RPI4 and other arm8 cpu based boards ...
* [x] Linux armv7(armv7-unknown-linux-gnueabihf) - arm 32bit cpus: RP4(32bit), RPI3, RPI2, RPI zero ...
* [ ] Windows x84_64
* [ ] Windows aarch64
* [ ] MacOS
* [ ] FreeBSD

## Basic installation
### Install or upgrade
RSPlayer can be installed using one of two methods:
* Using installation script(it will detect your architecture)
```bash
bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ljufa/rsplayer/master/install.sh)
```
* Manually download and install deb package
The latest package can be downloaded from [this page](https://github.com/ljufa/rsplayer/releases/latest).

* Download and manually install binary file (for non debian based linux)
  - Under latest release page find `rsplayer_*` file for your system amd download
  - rename file to `rsplayer`
  - make it executable using `chmod +x rsplayer`
  - run using command `./rsplayer`
  - optionally if you need to run rsplayer automatically as as a service use [this systemd service file](../PKGS/debian/etc/systemd/system/rsplayer.service)

### Verify installation
* Run systemd service by `sudo systemctl start rsplayer`
* Check service status by `sudo systemctl status rsplayer` and if it shows active go to the next step
* Open browser at http://you-machine-ip-address i.e. http://raspberrypi.local. 

?>TIP: If port 80 is not available it will automatically fall back to port 8000 so in this case UI will be available at http://raspberrypi.local:8000. Custom port can be specified by editing `/etc/systemd/system/rsplayer.service` file

# Basic configuration
## Players
By default, RSPlayer is configured to use its own media player.
To make configuration changes navigate to [http://rsplayer.local/#settings](http://rsplayer.local/#settings).

### RSP
RSPlayer playback implementation based on rust Symphonia crate.
* _Input buffer size_ - Size of input audio buffer

## Audio interface
This is an alsa audio interface that will be used by active player
## PCM Device
Alsa PCM output device of selected audio interface

## Music directory path
Full path to music root music directory, will be used by RSP.
Please keep in mind that after this value is changed or set for the first time `Update library` button should be clicked and the music database created.

## Volume control
* _Volume control device_ - Select volume control device: Dac or Alsa
* _Alsa mixer_ - If Alsa is volume control device then alsa mixer should be selected here
* _Volume step_ - How many units to send to the control device for a single button press or encoder step
* _Enable rotary encoder_ - Enable if you use a rotary encoder

# Advanced configuration for additional hardware support (RPI only)

## Install RPI OS
If you are going to install RPI os from scratch it is important to enable ssh, and wifi and specify the hostname.

  * For os image select _Raspberry PI OS Lite 64-bit_
  * Click on the gear icon and enable the following options

    ![](_assets/pi_imager_options.png ':size=450')

## Configure Raspberry PI
After installation is done ssh login to RPI `ssh pi@rsplayer.local` and make the following changes:
* Enable SPI and I2C options using `raspi-config` tool
* Make sure you have the following entries in `/boot/config.txt`:
    ```json
    dtoverlay=gpio-ir,gpio_pin=17
    dtoverlay=rotary-encoder,pin_a=15,pin_b=18,relative_axis=1,steps-per-period=1
    gpio=18,15,19=pu
    gpio=22,23=op,dh
    ```

 
-------
## External hardware devices
If you are using GPIO-connected hardware enable and configure it here
### Dac
* _DAC Chip_ - Currently there is only one AK DAC chip supported and tested
* _DAC I2C Address_ - I2C address of the DAC
* _Digital filter_ - Select one of the digital filters supported by DAC
* _Gain level_ - Select one of the analog output levels provided by DAC
* _Sound settings_ - Select one of the sound profiles provided by DAC

### IR Remote control
* _Remote maker_ - Chose the remote Model you want to use (atm only one remote is supported)
* _LIRC socket path_ - The default value should work in most cases.


### OLED
* _Display model_ - Select OLED model (currently one supported)
* _SPI Device path_ - The default value should work in most cases

### Audio output selector
* Enable if you use output selection relay

# Troubleshooting
?>If you can't access http://rsplayer.local from your android phone use RPI ip address or PC browser. At the time mDns/zeroconf is not supported by Android.

## Useful commands
* get logs 
```bash
journalctl -u rsplayer.service -f -n 300
```
* restart rsplayer 
```bash
sudo systemctl restart rsplayer
```
For configuration related troubleshooting you can find configuration file at `/opt/rsplayer/configuration.yaml`
